Ever been to a place where people usually go to network- such as a tech conference, with a goal of increasing linkedin connections from 0-200?
<br>
Or..possibly, think about the last time you went to a new city, aiming to connect with like minded professionals nearby, & end up meeting only a handful while the rest did not even know that you were visiting the area? Ah, the missed opportunity-
<br>
The days of writing on X- "hey guys am gonna be in xzc place on abc, wanna catch up?" & getting too few (or too many in some cases ahaha) is going to..dissapear!
<br>
Behold, our creation- the fruit of our strenous labour that made us go beserk in the last 36 hrs-
NETWORKHUB
<br>
LONG THINGS SHORT, it does 3 things :D
<ul><li>Find users in a place with a job profile- eg- find nearby developers in kolkata within a certain radius (we tried to implement mathematical formulas to estimate this)</li>
<li>Find users near a location- eg- find users in a 20km range of a particular coordinate</li>
<li>Find a random user ;3 from anywhere using the power of the almighty gemini ai agent </li>

<br>major point- We tried to implement Google Agent Development kit.
<br>the agent uses its own consciousness to choose which tool should be called for each occassion & calls that

<br>We tried to use an api on server, integrating it with frontend, giving it a friendly chat interface so that folks using our website can also know about their suitable meetup point or interact without using personal details till they meet.
